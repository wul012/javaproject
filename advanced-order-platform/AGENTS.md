## Runtime Archive Folder

For future Java version work, put run/debug explanations and screenshots in `b/`, which is a sibling of the old `a/` archive folder.

Use this shape:

```text
b/<version>/解释/说明.md
b/<version>/图片/*.png
```

Keep the old `a/` folder as historical archive for earlier versions. Do not move old `a/<version>` records unless the user explicitly asks.

When finishing a version, the final report should mention the `b/<version>` archive path.

## Docker Shutdown Fast Path

When Docker was started only for this Java project validation, close it quickly during cleanup.

Use this order:

```powershell
$dockerCli = 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe'
if (Test-Path $dockerCli) { & $dockerCli -Shutdown 2>$null }
Start-Sleep -Seconds 8
docker info *> $null
if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
  Get-Process |
    Where-Object {
      $_.ProcessName -in @(
        'Docker Desktop',
        'DockerCli',
        'com.docker.backend',
        'com.docker.proxy',
        'com.docker.dev-envs',
        'com.docker.extensions'
      )
    } |
    Stop-Process -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
  Start-Sleep -Seconds 8
}
docker info *> $null
$dockerStopped = $LASTEXITCODE -ne 0
```

Do not spend minutes waiting on `Docker Desktop.exe -Shutdown` alone. It can leave Docker responsive for too long.

Before stopping Docker, confirm project Testcontainers are done and no containers need to remain running:

```powershell
docker ps -a --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}'
```

Do not remove Docker volumes, images, or user containers unless the user explicitly asks.
